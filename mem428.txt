This ZIP file includes a couple of simple utilities to assist in
determining how much memory your PC can or has supplied to OS/2 2.0.

The program MEMBIOS.EXE (source in MEMBIOS.C) can be run from a
native mode DOS (not an OS/2 VDM) to determine how much contiguous
extended memory your PC will report during the OS/2 boot procedure.
It should be used under DOS where no Memory Managers (e.g. QEMM, 386Max)
are running.  If a Memory Manager is running, the call it uses will
report nothing available.

The program MEMAVL20.EXE (source in MEMAVL20.C) can be run from an
OS/2 2.0 command line to report three values:

  1. Total Physical Memory in PC
  2. Memory used by 'resident' modules
  3. Total Virtual Memory available for allocation (includes disk space)

I hope these modules can assist you in determining how well OS/2 2.0
makes use of your PC.  Obviously there are other factors that determine
how much memory OS/2 can use on your PC, so there are no guarantees
that the values reported by these programs have any validity.

If you have any comments, reply to Richard Stafford 73750,2305.
